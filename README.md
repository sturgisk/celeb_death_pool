# Celebrity Death Pool

## Description
Was made over a weekend for a group of friends, just a side project to mess around with.  No real sigup process or passwords required, just username creation.  Not optimized for mobile and could be improved all around.

## Setup
* My Config:  Ubuntu Droplet via Digital Ocean using MongoDB Atlas (Free tier)
* sudo apt install npm
* npm install express mongoose body-parser
* Put DB info in .env file (MONGODB_URI)
* Generate SSL and put in ssl/
* Start: node --trace-warnings server.js
